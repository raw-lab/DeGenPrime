needs to be able to accept non-aligned and aligned files
for non-aligned:
    - support for .fna and .fasta files
    -this will be done later with an R or Rust wiget
        - ask Dr. White about how to handle .fna
for aligned files
- score the aligned files
- sort the primers by amount of degeneracy
- lower will mean better. degen of 0 has a score of 0, degen of 1 has a score of 1, degen of 2 has a score of 2, degen of 3 has a score of 4 and should disqualify.
- need to be able to make forward and reverse primers for the PCR
    - look at PCR link that Dr. White will send later

may end up with two primers that are equally as good - have a way to handle this
ideally a degen of 3 should stop scoring on a sequence, since we are trying to avoid this at all costs.
