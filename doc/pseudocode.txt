needs to be able to accept non-aligned and aligned files
for non-aligned:
    - support for .fna and .fasta files
    -call MAFFT
        - subprocess - calls command in the terminal for you
        - needs to be imported in the code, this is done w MetaCerberus if I need help
         - possible solution -  $mafft --globalpair --maxiterate 1000 --clustalout file.fasta >file_global.clust
    //-this will be done later with an R or Rust wiget
        - ask Dr. White about how to handle .fna
    -needleman-wunsch algorithm, wikipedia provides pseudocode for this
for aligned files
- score the aligned files
- sort the primers by amount of degeneracy
- lower will mean better. degen of 0 has a score of 0, degen of 1 has a score of 1, degen of 2 has a score of 2, degen of 3 has a score of 4 and should disqualify.
- if veery sequence in the same position is the same, it is a score of 0
-need to consider degeneracy scores - can be a 70/30 split or a 50/50
- need to be able to make forward and reverse primers for the PCR
    - look at PCR link that Dr. White will send later
 - need a dictionary to score degeneracy
 - harder for it to prime if there are two+ bases next to one another, should penalize if we have more than three base pairs repeating
 -start with nucleotide scoring and then can move on to protein
 - default amplification should be the entire thing, can specify the amount of BP to amplify
 -positional arguments as well
 -after the primer is made, need to score again to make sure it doesn't stick to itself (primer dimers)
 -ideally we have zero self-complimentarity
 

may end up with two primers that are equally as good - have a way to handle this
ideally a degen of 3 should stop scoring on a sequence, since we are trying to avoid this at all costs.
